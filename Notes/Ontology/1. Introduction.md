# 1. Introduction
This document provides a non-normative high-level overview of the OWL 2 Web Ontology Language and serves as a roadmap for the documents that define and describe OWL 2.

Ontologies are formalised vocabularies of terms, often covering a specific domain and shared by a community of users. They specify the definitions of terms by describing their relationships with other terms in the ontology. 

Figure below gives an overview of the OWL 2 language, showing its main building blocks and how they relate to each other.

The ellipse in the center represents the abstract notion of an ontology, which can be thought of either as an abstract structure or as an RDF graph ([ontology](./2.1 ontology.md)).
